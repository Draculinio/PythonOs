# Python OS

**Python OS** is an experimental open source operating system — built by and for code nerds.  
The goal is simple: create a playground where anyone can explore how an OS works, fork it, break it, improve it, and discuss the process together.

## ✨ What is this?

- A minimal 32-bit operating system written in C (with a touch of assembly).  
- Bootable via GRUB and runnable on QEMU.  
- A live project: not stable, not polished, but open for experimentation.  

Think of it less as a finished product and more as a **laboratory** for operating system design.
